DESCRIPTION
Jumping to the next / previous search match is such a common command in Vim
that the n / N keys quickly become deeply ingrained in muscle memory. So
when one has defined a custom search (e.g. aided by the SearchSpecial.vim
(vimscript #4948) plugin), one is tempted to use n / N to repeat those,
too, but the keys will just continue to perform the default search. An
intelligent overloading of n / N is also desirable because these
single-key commands allow for quick single-stroke repeat, and there aren't
many other keys left for mapping custom searches to.

This plugin overloads the n and N commands so that custom searches (i.e.
anything except the default search via /, ?, [g]*, [g]#) can be repeated.
Activation of a custom search makes that search the new type of search to be
repeated, until the search type is changed again. The default search is
included in that via the `/` and ? commands, too.

SEE ALSO
- The SearchSpecial.vim (vimscript #4948) plugin provides generic functions
  for special search modes. Check out its plugin page for a full list of
  custom searches powered by it.

USAGE
n / N               Repeat the last used type of search.

gn                      List all registered search types, keys to
                        (re-)activate, and optional related search commands
                        that activate or configure that type.
                        The currently active search type is highlighted.

Some custom searches provide dedicated :Search... commands that also activate
the search repeat. Apart from that, you usually select and execute a custom
search type via its gn... integration mapping.
To change the search type back to plain normal search (without changing the
search pattern), just type '/<Enter>'.

EXAMPLE
Let's define a simple custom search that positions the current search result
in the middle of the window (using zz). These mappings just delegate to the
default n command, open a fold (zv, because that's not done automatically
from a mapping), and then append the zz command:
    nnoremap <silent> <Plug>(SearchAtCenterOfWindowNext) :<C-u>execute 'normal!' v:count1 . 'nzvzz'<CR>
    nnoremap <silent> <Plug>(SearchAtCenterOfWindowPrev) :<C-u>execute 'normal!' v:count1 . 'Nzvzz'<CR>

Then, integrate these into SearchRepeat, using gnzz and gnzZ to activate them:
    call SearchRepeat#Define(
    \   "\<Plug>(SearchAtCenterOfWindowNext)", '', 'zz', '/win-center/', 'Search forward,  position at center of window', '',
    \   "\<Plug>(SearchAtCenterOfWindowPrev)", '', 'zZ', '?win-center?', 'Search backward, position at center of window', '',
    \   2
    \)

The gn command will now show the (two forward / backward variants of the)
newly added custom search in addition to the built-in standard search:
activation      description     helptext
        /       Standard search forward
        ?       Standard search backward
gnzz            win-center      Search forward,  position at center of window
gnzZ            win-center      Search backward, position at center of window

To activate, search for /something, then press gnzz. From now on, the n /
N commands will also center the match (and the gnzz search type is
highlighted in the gn list), until you reset the search type with another
/search.
